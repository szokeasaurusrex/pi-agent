# Planning

Use this skill whenever the user asks to plan work.

## Always do this first

- Ask clarifying questions early and often.
- Do not guess when requirements are ambiguous.
- When multiple valid options exist, ask the user to choose.
- Proactively surface edge cases and ask how each should be handled.
- Continue question/answer iteration until the direction is clear.

## Choose exactly one mode

- **Plan-only request** (the user asks only for a plan): load `references/plan-only.md` and follow it.
- **Plan-and-implement request** (the user asks to both plan and execute in one go): load `references/plan-and-implement.md` and follow it.

Do **not** load both reference files for the same task.
